First differentiable (physics-constrained ML) model of mountain snow transport and redistribution

# Constraining Kilometer-Scale Mountain Snow Transport and Snowshed Areas
* Single-author publication at _Geophysical Research Letters:_ https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL113599
* A differentiable modeling framework constrains the minimum seasonal snow transport required to explain observed snowpack patterns
* Kilometer-scale snow transport drives deep snow accumulation in a mountain region with alpine plateaus
* “Snowshed” maps extend the concept of the watershed to identify regions where snow is imported or exported across topographic divides
