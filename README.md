# snow_transport_network
* First differentiable (physics-constrained ML) model of mountain snow transport and redistribution
* Pre- and post-processing scripts in R using the sf/terra geospatial ecosystem (these scripts can be assumed to carry compatible licenses to the sf/terra packages)
* Core differentiable modeling scripts in Python using PyTorch (these scripts are licensed only under CC-NC-ND 4.0, i.e., no derivatives, non-commercial) 

# Constraining Kilometer-Scale Mountain Snow Transport and Snowshed Areas
* Single-author publication at _Geophysical Research Letters:_ https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL113599
* A differentiable modeling framework constrains the minimum seasonal snow transport required to explain observed snowpack patterns
* Kilometer-scale snow transport drives deep snow accumulation in a mountain region with alpine plateaus
* “Snowshed” maps extend the concept of the watershed to identify regions where snow is imported or exported across topographic divides
